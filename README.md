This Project “Healthcare Data Analysis Using Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm” aims to predict the health related diseases based on the data it gets trained. The major technologies involved in this project are Data collection, Data processing, Encoding, Model Training, Prediction. This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier for medical disease prediction based on symptoms. It utilizes a structured dataset containing patient symptoms and corresponding disease labels. The model is trained to classify diseases by recursively splitting data based on symptom severity and presence.

Key Features:

Data Processing: Cleans and prepares raw medical data for classification.

Decision Tree Model: Constructs an interpretable tree to predict diseases.

Visualization: Generates decision tree plots for model interpretability.

Testing & Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using test data.

The trained model aids in identifying potential diseases based on input symptoms, offering a preliminary diagnostic tool.
